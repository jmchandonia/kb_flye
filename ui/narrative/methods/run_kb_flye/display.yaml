    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for the <a href="https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye">Flye assembler</a>. Flye is a de novo assembler for single-molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete pipeline: it takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs.</p>

    <p>This app does not currently support Flye's metagenome assembly mode.</p>

    <p>More details on Flye can be found in publication [1] at the bottom of this App detail page</p>
